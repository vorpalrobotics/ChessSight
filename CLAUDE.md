# ChessSight — Standing Instructions for Claude Code

## Project
Chess training web app deployed at vorpalrobotics.github.io/ChessSight.
Static site (HTML/CSS/ES modules), no build step. GitHub Pages serves from `main`.

## Version number
`index.html` has `<title>ChessSight vN</title>`.
**Increment N by 1 before every commit.** This lets the user verify GitHub Pages
has deployed the latest version by checking the browser tab title.
Current version after the most recent commit is tracked in this file:

**Current version: v45**

## Commit & push discipline
- Develop on branch `claude/fix-engine-counter-moves-2O7sZ`, but always also push to `main`
  (GitHub Pages deploys from `main`).
- Use descriptive commit messages; include the session URL footer.

## Key libraries (all via CDN, no npm install)
- **cm-chessboard v8** — `Chessboard`, `COLOR`, `Arrows`, `Markers` extensions
- **chess.js v1** — `Chess`; use `moves({ verbose:true })`, `attackers(sq, color)`
- **Chart.js v4** — imported as ESM (`chart.js@4/+esm`) in app.js

## Architecture
- `js/app.js` — screen routing, engine mode, hamburger/modals, Chart.js history
- `js/checks.js`, `captures.js`, `loose.js`, `under.js`, `forks.js` — drill modules
- `js/storage.js` — IndexedDB helpers (`upsertDrillDay`, `getAllRecords`)
- `css/style.css` — all styles (dark theme, CSS custom properties)
- `index.html` — single-page app, all screens as `div.screen`

## Drill pattern
Every drill module exports `initDrill(navigateFn)` and `startDrill()`.
Board is created once (lazy) with `new Chessboard(...)` and reused via `setPosition`.
SHOW button toggles solution overlay (arrows for moves, SVG rects for piece-based drills).
Arrow labels are placed at 75% along the line (near the arrowhead).

## IDB storage key
Compound key `[date, drill]` in store `drillDays`.
`upsertDrillDay(drill, { seconds, correct, misses, puzzleId })` accumulates daily totals.

## Hamburger menu items
- **About** — attribution modal
- **History** — Chart.js progress charts (avg time + accuracy per drill)
- **Debug** — raw IDB data table (remove before customer release)

## Fork drill definition
A fork move attacks 2+ enemy pieces that are each a real threat:
- The king (always qualifies), OR
- Strictly greater value than the forking piece — profitable capture even if defended, OR
- Loose (zero defenders) — free capture regardless of value
A defended piece worth equal to or less than the forking piece does NOT qualify.
AND the attack must be newly created by the move (piece did not already attack
that square before moving).
AND the forking piece's landing square must be safe (no enemy piece worth ≤ the
forking piece, and no enemy king, may immediately recapture).
(P=1, N/B=3, R=5, Q=9, K=∞)
